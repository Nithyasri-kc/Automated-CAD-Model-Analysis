# Automated-CAD-Model-Analysis
This repository contains a Python script for the automated analysis of 3D CAD models saved in the Standard Tessellation Language (.stl) format. The script uses the numpy-stl library to provide a detailed report on key properties of the model, which is essential for tasks such as 3D printing, engineering, and digital fabrication.

Key Features
Surface Area Calculation: Accurately calculates the total surface area of the 3D model by summing the area of each individual triangle.
Volume and Mass Properties: Computes the total volume, center of gravity (COG), and inertia matrix.
Bounding Box Dimensions: Determines the length, width, and height of the model's bounding box, providing its overall dimensions.
Triangle Count: Reports the total number of triangles (facets) that make up the model.
